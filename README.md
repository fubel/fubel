### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a research assistant and PhD student at the Institute of Human-Machine Communication of the Technical University of Munich, Germany. My main research is in computer vision and pattern recognition.

Prior to joining TU Munich, I did my Master's in Scientific Computing in GÃ¶ttingen with a focus on mathematical image processing. I then worked for fino as a data scientist.
